# OneShotDL
A comparative study of Deep Learning methods for One Shot Image Classification.

This repository is used by post-master Data Science trainees at JADS (Jheronimus Academy of Data Science) to experiment with and compare different deep learning based approaches for one shot image classification. Currently, the focus is on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.
